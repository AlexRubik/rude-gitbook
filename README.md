# Requirements

**Offering access to my RPC and Jup API for a limited time! Send a friend request to @alexdev777 on Discord!**

## Minimum Requirements

* Jupiter's free/public v6 API (https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6)
* Access to an RPC node
* Linux Operating System\
  \- Windows users can use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* Small amount of SOL and/or USDC to pay for transaction fees and Flash Loan fees (if enabled)

## Suggested Specifications

* Jupiter v6 API with no or high rate limit
* RPC node with no or high rate limit
* Linux OS
* Base token balances to cover the trade sizes you want to capture (Flash Loans make your transactions too large/slow sometimes)

## Ideal Specifications

* Run your own RPC node
* On a separate server in the same data center as your RPC node, host your Jup API using your RPC node. Run your bots on these servers if they can spare CPU and RAM usage. If you want a complete separation of concerns, run your bots on a 3rd separate server in the same data center.
* Linux OS
* Base token balances to cover the trade sizes you want to capture
